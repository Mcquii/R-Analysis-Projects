# R-Analysis-Projects
A selection of R code projects I've written

Multivariate Classification Model:
This project utilizes data from the UCI Machine Learning Respository (http://mlr.cs.umass.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone). The goal was to create a model that can classify Abalone gender based on the measured physical characteristics provided in the dataset.

First Down Success in the NFL
This project uses the NFLscrapR package to pull thousands of individual play datapoints from NFL seasons. The goal was to create a model that could accurately predict whether a successful first down was made on that snap based on information about the play.

MTG Wins by Color Analysis:
This is a pet project related to the popular TCG Magic: the Gathering. The goal of the project is to determine which colors to prioritize in MtG drafts based on my performance with decks using that color.
