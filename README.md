# R-Analysis-Projects
A selection of R code projects I've written

Multivariate Classification Model:
This project utilizes data from the UCI Machine Learning Respository (http://mlr.cs.umass.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone). The goal was to create a model that can classify Abalone gender based on the measured physical characteristics provided in the dataset.


MTG Wins by Color Analysis:
This is a pet project related to the popular TCG Magic: the Gathering. The goal of the project is to determine which colors to prioritize in MtG drafts based on my performance with decks using that color.
